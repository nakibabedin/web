    <h2>Why soccer isn't as popular as gootball, basketball, etc.</h2>
    <p> Soccer was a sport that Britain diffused to America. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, America and Britain did not like each other and many Americans didn't play soccer as a way to protest and the sport never kicked off since then. Football and basketball did not face this challenge and soccer has been the less popular sport in America ever since.

    <h2>Why I like Soccer</h2>
    <p>
    I like soccer because it is a sport that people of any height can play. I've never been that tall growing up so sports like basketball and football were tough for me. However, there are many positions in soccer where you do not need to be tall and it became my favorite sport the more I played it.

    <h2> Best player in Soccer</h2>
    <p>
    In my opinion, Messi will always be the greatest soccer player ever. Ronaldo provides a good challenge, but Messi is not from this world. In terms of individual ability, there has never been anyone like him, and I don't think there will ever be anyone like him either.
